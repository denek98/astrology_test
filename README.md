# Test Task Repository

## Overview

This repository contains three independent test tasks, each addressing a different problem. Each task is organized in its own directory, and detailed descriptions and instructions are provided in the respective `README.md` files within each folder.

## Task Descriptions

- **Task 1**: Analysis of astrologer performance based on chat statistics. SQL queries to evaluate astrologers and make decisions about their continued engagement.

- **Task 2**: Currency exchange rate (EUR/USD) forecasting using a predictive model based on historical data retrieved via an API. The implementation includes plotting the actual and predicted exchange rates.

- **Task 3**: Designing a data structure for a new feature that allows astrologers to ping users. The task involves creating tables to track astrologer activity, conversion rates, and revenue.
